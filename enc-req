There is one central router API.
It receives:

dealId

enrichmentType

Some metadata

Based on enrichmentType, it must call the correct downstream enrichment service.

And now we add multi-tenant behavior on top of that.

If enrichmentType = ADR → call ADR service

That is basic routing.

Now add one more dimension:
